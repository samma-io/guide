## Time to work with the dashbourd


## Grafana
Let's start looking at the Grafana dashboard. We use Grafan to get an overlook of the result of the scanners and to monitor 
if any new problems come up.

Samma provides a Grafana standard dashboard that we use as base and then modified.


Open the dashbourd in minikube


```
 minikube service samma -n samma-io
```
This will open tree taps fins the Grafana tab and login 

**user: samma password: samma-io**

Open the samma dashbourd in grafana

### Scanner scanners are based on time

One of the key values in Samma scanner are targat scan is based on time.
So all findings will only be shown for the time you have selected.

This means if you scan a target yesterday and then are looking at the result today, Then the finings of that target will not show.


Here is how you select hos to show the correct time frame.

### Lets make a new dashbourd
To make a new dashbourd let find some values that we like. Go to the *explore* page.
- Verify we are using the samma-elasticsearch datasource
- the timeframe are so we have targets.

First lets find all tsunami scanners

![Grafana find!](assets/grafana3.png)



Know when we have the right scanners lets find all the ports the scanner did find.

We also have the port scanner nmap. So lets add all the ports that our nmap scanner did find.

Lets add this grafe to our samma.io dashbourd

- Open the dashboard
- Klick new "Add panel" (righ corner)
- Select "Add new panel"
- Verify the data source is "Samma-elasticsearch"
- Fill in the same values as before
- Save

And know we have success search for new values in the scan result and built a new graf.



To find more points of interest open the explorer tap and select different fields. 
(Grafana show all field in elastic and when we choose the scanner type example tsunami. Then there is only the fields from the tsunami scanner that will give any result.)






## Kibana
Kibana is used to search in the scanner result. You can search for Apache and find all result that where found with the Apacha webserver.
Before we can start using Kibana we need to setup a index pattern and mappings. This will help kibana when we search for values.
It≈õ good to to this after some scans have run so we always have a updated index pattern. If we add any new scanner that new scanner will add more fields and then we need to update the index mapping again.



### Lets setup kibana
- Go to stack manegment
- Kibana Index Pattern
- Create new 
- samma-io.* will find the samma.io index 
- Set time to @timestamp
- Go to Kibana discover and look at the result (check time)
